The graph shows the density of ratings for Edinburgh airbnbs based on Neighborhood, starting from the highest median rated neighborhoods to the lowest. The graph only looks at the density of ratings that range from 75 to 100 due to the low volume of ratings below 75 which makes it harder to see comparisons clearly. Most Airbnbs are rated similarly in Edinburgh irregardless of neighboorhood, around 95 to 100, with the highest median (Morningside) only beating out the lowest median (Haymarket) by less than  5 points. NA ended up being the highest rated as well as having the second highest number of variables (2294), though because the neighborhood is data is missing, it is impossible to draw any conclusions from this. 

I kept the variable in because it is a significant number of data points to ignore but colored it faintly so that it does not distract from the information I want to show.

# read all files and row bind them
# keeping track of the file name in a new column called year
pac <- read_csv(list_of_files, id = "year")
```
